# About

A very simple example to experiment with Dapper and MS-Access for bulk insert and read back.

## Important

The Add list when executing Dapper uses a loop to insert so if adding 100 records there is a loop of 100.

For better performace look at [Dapper BulkInsert library](https://www.learndapper.com/bulk-operations/bulk-insert).
