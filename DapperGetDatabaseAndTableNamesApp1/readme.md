# About

Mirror image of the console project DapperGetDatabaseAndTableNamesApp

## Differences

- In this project we use `asynchronous` database operations so to keep the form responsive. 
    - The asynchronous methods used here can be used in other project types too.
- Rather than print results to a console, results are placed into a `TextBox` build up in a `StringBuilder`.
