# Replying to forum questions


When a coder just starting out ask a question how to assist with a task and they show current code in a Windows Forms project and all the code is in the form its best not to have them move code to a class.


Given them code in the form and perhaps introduce a class which represents data collected in form controls. Instruct them to take the class (which I tend to place in the form) and place in its own file. This is important because they are still green, let them first run the code then leave as is or move the class to a separate file.

In this project validation is used although when answering a simple question for a new coder do not introduce validation as done in this project as most will not understand this.

## Critial

What I have learned from answering forum questions for thirty years, feel out what can be feed to the person asking the question to what they may take from what they may understand. DO NOT push them to follow strict standards, instead tell them if warranted where to go from here or simply give them a solution to their question and leave it there.

I know some will disagree with this but these who disagree most likely never have assisted answering questions in developer forums and forget what its like when first starting out to many it can be difficult to perform specific tasks. 

Bottom line, learn to be gentle.

## Validation 

[FluentValidation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentValidation/11.9.0?_src=template) library is used.
